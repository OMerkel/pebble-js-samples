<blockquote><p><b>DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE.</b>
</p><p>
... when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
</p><p>
There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" ... but when the Rabbit
actually took a Pebble watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and
looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,
for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a
rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a Pebble watch to take
out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p></blockquote>

_... from Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland"._
